# GetPixel2
GetPixel2 has been made as kind of cheat for games (for instance when your Health bar is too low then program automaticly clicks a button).

After clicking "OK" you have 2 seconds to set the mouse's position. After that the program will save a pixel's color and click "r" hotkey when this pixel changes its color.

A short demonstration how does program work: https://youtu.be/NiXmLj7V-F4

In case of changing a hotkey you have to replace line 44 "ip.ki.wVk = 0x52" for an another code (of the specific hotkey).

Program made by Visual Studio 2017 using winAPI librays
